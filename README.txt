description : 'Leap Motion RTC Testing Project. To use LeapRTC, you need to add the Leap.dll/libleap.so to PATH, which enables system to find the Leap Motion SDK library. In windows, to copy the Leap.dll (x86 version) into C:/Windows/SysWow64 directory is the best way to do so. In Linux, to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH would be a good way.'
